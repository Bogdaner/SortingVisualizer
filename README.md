# SortingVisualizer

Simple app written in CPP to visualize different sorting algorithms. Project uses [SFML + ImGuI](https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml) for graphics stuff. The goal was to learn CMAKE and write cross platform app also I want to see what ImGuI offers. Project will **download all dependencies during CMAKE configure time**.
